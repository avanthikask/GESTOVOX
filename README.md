This project creates a system for natural human-computer interaction using real-time hand gestures (via webcam and MediaPipe) and voice commands (via microphone). It enables contactless control through applications like a virtual keyboard and mouse, gesture-based volume control, a digital drawing tool, and gesture-controlled games (car racing) and voice-controlled games (Snake). The system is implemented in Python and aims to make computer interaction more intuitive and accessible across various domains.
